# Facebook Dimmer

A Chrome extension that keeps track of how long you spend on facebook, and dims your screen the longer you face that book.

This extension counts the number of minutes you've been active on facebook over the last four hours. It then sets the opacity of the page to that number divided by sixty (the percentage of an hour you've been facebooking). The four-hour window is always moving forward, so eventually, you'll get back up to full speed. It doesn't go completely invisible until your sixty minutes are up, though, so you can still peek back and see where your'e at... and the minutes will start ticking down again.

The extension is available on the Chrome extension store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-dimmer/mlhnmfdgjlnohhhggdeodoehlfcnhgld

(Current version: 0.1.2)

## TODO

* Add user-customizable time windows and maximum allowed time within that window.
* Allow the user to add more sited to the dimmer.
